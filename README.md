# SDP-2018
The System Design Project is a Semester 2 module and is a group project involving construction of an item of significant complexity under conditions designed to give insights into industrial teamwork. This year's task is to use Lego and an Arduino to design an assistive robotic device, with an appropriate software interface.

The main features include the games it has to play games, fitness (sound, music, light), memory, companionship (sensor on head or emotion detection using camera, random sounds at times)

Sensors - 2-4 buttons, microphone, ultrasonic for table, gyrosonic, camera.

Actuators - 6 motors for arms and legs, LEDs, Speakers.

Features good to have - Table awareness, facing the user, speech recognition.
